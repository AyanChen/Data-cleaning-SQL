In this project, I performed data cleaning using SQL.
The goal was to prepare the data for further analysis by removing errors and unnecessary information.Steps Performed

-Remove Duplicates — eliminated duplicate records
-Standardize the Data — unified formatting (e.g., text, dates)
-Handle Null or Blank Values — processed missing or empty values
-Remove Unnecessary Columns — dropped irrelevant columns that do not add value to analysis

Result: The dataset is now clean, standardized, and ready for analysis and reporting.
